Created in the Winter semester of 2016

Project by: **Cameron Husted --- Ryan Fecteau --- Joseph DiTrapani**

## Autonomous Turret Proof-of-Concept

For this project, we built a wooden box that housed our electrical components, as well as the Arduino Uno controller.
On the outside of the box were 5 wood panels, each with a piezoelectric sensor attached to it.
When an object hit one of the panels, the sensors would register the vibration and send a signal to the Arduino.

A small laser-pointer on top would swivel to the corresponding angle that the "attack" came from, and would "fire" (turn on) for a length of time proportional to the strength of the impact.

The laser pointer could also be manually controlled and fired via a small joystick on the apparatus.
